        <!-- <h4>GLOSSARY</h4> -->
       <p><strong>Loss of Standard Separation (LoSS). </strong>A loss of separation between aircraft occurs whenever specified separation minima in controlled airspace are breached. Minimum separation standards for airspace are specified by Air Traffic Service authorities, based on ICAO standards.</p>
	   <p><strong>Runway Incursion. </strong>Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft.</p>

    <h3>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Similar Sounding Call Signs course. By the end of the course you will be able to recognize Similar Sounding Call Signs and the hazards associated with them, identify national procedures for Similar Sounding Call Signs, identify phraseology for Similar Sounding Call Signs, and identify the best practices for Similar Sounding Call Signs. For course and navigation information, select the associated buttons on the screen.</p>
    
    <h3>CALL SIGN SIMILARITIES</h3>
    <p>Call signs can be similar in various ways, including:</p>
 	<ul>
		<li>Flight numbers</li>
		<li>Operator names</li>
		<li>Tail numbers</li>
  </ul>    
     
    <h3>GRABBING THE WRONG STRIP</h3>
    <p>Take a close look at these flight strips. Notice how the call signs differ in the last two digits.</p>
	<p>These subtle differences can be easily overlooked. You could accidentally grab the wrong strip and misidentify an aircraft.</p>
	<p>Always carefully evaluate each flight progress strip.</p>
    
    <h3>CLARITY IS KEY</h3>
    <p>Emphasize appropriate digits, letters, or similar sounding words to aid in distinguishing between similar sounding aircraft identifications.</p>
	<p>Ensure that pilot-to-controller readback is accurate.</p>
	
    
    <h3>PRONOUNCING CALL SIGNS</h3>
    <p>Air carrier and other civil aircraft having FAA authorized call signs may be pronounced using single digits if necessary for clarity.</p>
 	<p>For example, UNITED FIVE ONE SEVEN instead of, UNITED FIVE SEVENTEE</p>
    
    <h3>NOTIFY EACH PILOT</h3>
    <p>Air traffic controllers must notify each pilot concerned when communicating with aircraft having similar sounding identifications.</p>
	<p>The controller must notify the operations supervisor-in-charge of any duplicate flight identification numbers or phonetically similar sounding call signs when the aircraft are operating simultaneously within the same sector.</p>
    <p>NOTE: This is especially important when this occurs on a repetitive, rather than isolated basis.</p>
	<p>"UNITED THIRTY−ONE UNITED, MIAMI CENTER, AMERICAN THIRTY−ONE IS ALSO ON THIS FREQUENCY, ACKNOWLEDGE."</p>
    <p>"AMERICAN THIRTY−ONE AMERICAN, MIAMI CENTER, UNITED THIRTY−ONE IS ALSO ON THIS FREQUENCY, ACKNOWLEDGE."</p>
    
    
    <h3>HAZARDS</h3>
    <p>Failure to clarify similar sounding call signs creates major hazards for the safety of the NAS.</p>
	<p>These hazards include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Aircraft Collisions</li>
		<li>Runway Incursions</li>
		<li>LoSS</li>
		<li>Pilot Deviation</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Wrong Aircraft Acknowledgement</strong>A pilot may execute a clearance intended for another aircraft.</p>
	<p>To mitigate the risk, do not abbreviate:</p>
	<ul>
    <li>Similar sounding aircraft identifications</li>
    <li>Identifications of air carriers</li>
    <li>Other civil aircraft having an FAA authorized call sign</li>
	</ul>
  <p>Never abbreviate similar sounding call signs.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Aircraft Misidentification</strong>The air traffic controller was directing two flights, N813JP and N324JP, which shared the last two identification letters "JP."</p>
	<p>N324JP requested gradual descent, but the air traffic controller responded to N813JP.</p>
	<p>After recognizing that N324JP responded to the instructions for N813JP, the controller quickly re-assigned the correct altitude for N324JP.</p>
    
    <h3>BEST PRACTICES</h3>
	<p>Add destination to clarify call sign if necessary.</p>
	<p>"DELTA EIGHT FORTY FOUR TO PORTLAND, TAXI TO RWY 35L."</p>
	<p>When handing off, ensure receiving controller knows to expect aircraft with similar sounding call signs on their frequency.</p>
	<p>"DELTA FORTY TWO AND DELTA EIGHT FORTY TWO ARE BACK TO BACK, READY FOR DEPARTURE."</p>
	<p>Be vigilant; listen carefully to readbacks and listen for similar sounding call signs.</p>
    
    
    <h3>COURSE SUMMARY</h3>
    <p>The topics we just covered came in part from people like you.</p>
	<p>Here's a few things to remember from the course. Recognize Similar Sounding Call Signs and the hazards associated with them, identify national procedures for Similar Sounding Call Signs, identify phraseology for Similar Sounding Call Signs, and identify best practices for Similar Sounding Call Signs.</p>
	<p>To keep recurrent training real and relevant, please keep filing ATSAP reports as appropriate. ATSAP is the key to developing and improving procedures.</p>
	<p>Thank you for your time and your commitment to improve the National Airspace System for all of us</p>
